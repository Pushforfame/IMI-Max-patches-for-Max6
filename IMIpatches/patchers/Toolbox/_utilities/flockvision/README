Contents:

- lens_correction.pat
Corrects for "barrel/pin" distortion, commonly resulting from fisheye lens.

- stitcher.pat
Finds a least-squared error transformation to warp one image into the space of another. This transform, in addition to a blending algorithm, can stitch images together, like for panoramic images.

- skew_correction.pat
Uses a least-squared error transformation to correct for skew in an image, typically caused by perspective. This is based on correcting a warped calibration rectangle in the image to a true rectangle.

- ParticleFilter.java/class (mxj external)
Implements a (slightly simplified) version of the popular particle filtering tracking algorithm. Basically, particles of a given target sample the image. Those with high probability mass (i.e. over a target's pixel) is more likely sampled the next frame. In this way, a target's particles tend to stick with it.
